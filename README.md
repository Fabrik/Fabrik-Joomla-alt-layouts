# bootstrap3-jlayouts
Series of Fabrik jLayout overrides for Joomla templates that use bootstrap 3 &amp; font awsome.

Tested against https://www.joomlart.com/joomla/templates/purity-iii

To test, copy the files in this folder in 

/templates/purity_iii/html/layouts/com_fabrik

If you want to test another template, copy these files into that template's folder (so substitute your template name for purity_iii in the above path).  If the render results are incorrect, report the issue on our forums.  If necessary, we may create other template specific branches.

We are aware that there is an issue with "disappearing labels" when using tooltips, whereby the element label will be hidden on mouseout when the tooltip gets hidden.  We are working on a fix for this.
